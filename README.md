### Reinforcement Learning (Deep Q-Learning)

This project focuses on developing a reinforcement learning model for playing the game Pong. Inspired by the classic Atari game, the aim is to train an agent using the Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm to play against either a computer-controlled or human opponent. The project explores the game mechanics, the challenges of reinforcement learning in reward sparse environments, and the concept of reward shaping. A custom Pong environment is created, allowing the incorporation of additional information and the implementation of reward shaping techniques. The DQN algorithm is implemented using Python and the Keras package from TensorFlow.

### Hybrid Music Recommendation System

In this project, a hybrid methodology combining content-based and collaborative filtering techniques was utilized to develop a music recommendation system. To train the AI model, a combination of algorithms was employed, including the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) model and the Surprise Libraries implementation inspired by Simon Funk, who achieved success in the Netflix Prize using his model (known as Funk-SVD).

The SVD model, based on matrix factorization, predicts a rating (represented as $\hat{r}_{u, i}) that a user (u) will assign to an item (i), where the item in this case refers to a song. This prediction is determined by calculating the dot product of two matrices: q_{i} (representing item latent factors) and p_{u}$ (representing user latent factors). The SVD model's objective function employs stochastic gradient descent, which iteratively reduces the prediction error.

To optimize the model's performance, various parameters are available for customization. These parameters control the number of epochs (iterations) performed during training, the number of latent factors to be discovered, and hyperparameters such as the learning rate and regularization term, which influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of the model.

To further refine the recommendation system's accuracy and quality of suggestions, swarm-intelligence methods were employed to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, ensuring the best possible results for personalized music recommendations.
